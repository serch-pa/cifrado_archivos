This hit, that ice cold
Michelle Pfeiffer, that white gold
This one for them hood girls
Them good girls
Straight masterpieces

Stylin', wilin'
Livin' it up in the city
Got Chucks on with Saint Laurent
Gotta kiss myself
I'm so pretty

I'm too hot (hot damn)
Call the police and the fireman
I'm too hot (hot damn)
Make a dragon wanna retire, man
I'm too hot (hot damn)
Say my name, you know who I am
I'm too hot (hot damn)
And my band 'bout that money
Break it down

Girls, hit your hallelujah (woo)
Girls, hit your hallelujah (woo)
Girls, hit your hallelujah (woo)

Wait a minute
Fill my cup, put some liquor in it
Take a sip, sign the check
Julio, get the stretch

Ride to Harlem, Hollywood
Jackson, Mississippi
If we show up, we gon' show out
Smoother than a fresh jar of Skippy

I'm too hot (hot damn)
Call the police and the fireman
I'm too hot (hot damn)
Make a dragon wanna retire, man
I'm too hot (hot damn) (hot damn)
Bitch, say my name, you know who I am

And my band 'bout that money
Break it down
